  - Builds on [Approximately Optimal Approximate Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/yoonholee/Reinforcement-Learning-Survey/blob/master/policy_gradient.md#approximately-optimal-approximate-reinforcement-learning-icml-2002)
  - Instead of using a linear mixture, TRPO uses average KL divergence to ensure that the next policy is sufficiently close to current policy(in practice, approximate L linearly and KL divergence quadratically)
  - The natural policy gradient has the same direction as TRPO; the difference is that TRPO chooses a step size based on the trust region defined by KL divergence
